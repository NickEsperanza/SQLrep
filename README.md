SQL queries and syntax
Attached are some SQL Queries and Syntax along with a project created through SQL. By using SQL and Tableau, I created a presentation for a fake rental movie company called "Rockbuster". This presentation was to analyze customer viewing and spending behavior across Rockbuster worldwide. Identifying things such as top customers, average viewing ength, most popular genres, inventory, etc. I then gave recommendations on how Rockbuster could improve and areas of interest.
